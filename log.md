# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Got back to an old project! Re-implementing data strucure in more Clojure-appropriate way.

**Thoughts** Looking back at how I've done the same things previously, it's interesting to see how more practice and experience can improve the way of thinking. Also, an hour a day seems doable so far.
