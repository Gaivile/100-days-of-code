# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Got back to an old project! Re-implementing data strucure in more Clojure-appropriate way.

**Thoughts** Looking back at how I've done the same things previously, it's interesting to see how more practice and experience can improve the way of thinking. Also, an hour a day seems doable so far.

### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Apparently, one hour is not enough when you get so much into a project! Today I'm continuing with data structures - got an idea how to represent a brick in Quil for collision detection. 

**Thoughts** I kinda desperately need to move to another editor... Bit of a shame - I'm still using LightTable - which is awesome at the very beginning stage as you can see the output of all the functions straight away and inside the editor. However, when you have a bit more dependencies - it refuses to work. Noticed this some time ago to be honest, and it's a "known issue". Where do I go...? What do I do...?
Emacs? Vim? IntelliJ? Sublime? Atom?
